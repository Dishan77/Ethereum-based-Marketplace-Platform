### Decentralized E-Commerce Platform


Built a decentralized e-commerce application that allows users to list, purchase, and manage digital or physical products on the Ethereum blockchain. The frontend is developed using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive UI. Smart contract logic is written in Solidity, ensuring transparent and trustless transactions. The platform supports secure item listing, purchasing, ownership transfers, and item removal, all powered by blockchain for enhanced security and decentralization.
